Node App for SMS/MMS Notifications of Changes to the Vendor Wares in Bungie's Destiny and On-Demand Database Queries

## Description

This project is a work in progress. I eventually intend to release an app for registering with this service. The problem this project intends to solve is to provide a quick and convenient way for users to query the Destiny database through short messages. For example, "Thorn" returns "Thorn Exotic Primary Hand Cannon". In addition, the service can also notify gamers who may not log on to Destiny on a daily basis, updates as to what items come up for sale when vendors refresh their stock. So for example when Xur finally sells that Gjallarhorn you've been dying for, you don't miss it.
