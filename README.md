Node application for SMS/MMS interface for receiving notifications of Vendor (Xur) inventory changes and on-demand weapon searches.

## Description

This project is a work in progress. I eventually intend to release an app for registering with this service. The problem this project intends to solve is to provide a quick and convenient way for users to query the Destiny database through short messages. For example, "Thorn" returns "Thorn Exotic Primary Hand Cannon". In addition, the service can also notify gamers, who may not log on to Destiny on a daily basis, updates as to what items come up for sale when vendors refresh their stock. So for example when Xur finally sells that Gjallarhorn you've been dying for, you don't miss it.

## Background

In the fall of 2007, I was introduced to Halo 3. I immediately fell in love with the game. Perhaps my greatest achievement as a gamer was completing the campaign on Legendary difficulty. Bungie moved on from Halo and released Destiny in the fall of 2014.

Destiny had some shortcomings from the start. Despite that, my imagination was captured by how the Destiny community found ways to fill the gaps. Developers shared apps for managing inventory, finding Public Events, and looking for a group (LFG). And what made these apps possible was Bungie's public Destiny API.

From a business perspective, I found this fascinating. By offering a public API, Bungie got to see what features the community wanted. Sometimes Bungie incorporated these features. And other times, Bungie embraced these 3rd party apps.

As a developer and a gamer, I wanted a fun portfolio project. At the time, I was impressed with the Twilio's developer experience for programmable SMS messages. So I came up with an application for receiving SMS messages for important Destiny events like "What is Xur selling today?" and a way to query the Destiny database over SMS. With this project, I try new things, apply what I've learned, and ask my phone after I get one-shotted in the Crucible, "What gun was thatâ€½"
