Node App for SMS/MMS Notifications of Changes to the Vendor Wares in Bungie's Destiny

## Description

This project is a work in progress. I eventually intend to release an app for registering with this service. The problem this project intends to solve is to provide a convenient way of notifying gamers who may not log on to Destiny on a daily basis anymore, updates as to what items come up for sale when vendors refresh their stock. So for example, when Xur finally sells that Gjallarhorn you've been dying for, you don't miss it.
